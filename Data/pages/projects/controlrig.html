        🕷 Procedural Spider Animation – Unreal Engine 5 (Control Rig)

Built a fully procedural locomotion system for a multi-legged spider character using UE5’s Control Rig—eliminating the need for traditional, pre-keyed animations.
        <br>
        <br>
        Implemented a fully procedural spider locomotion system in UE5’s Control Rig, including FullBodyIK setup for all legs, management of default foot transforms, and accurate world/rig space conversions. Developed a velocity-driven walk cycle with per-leg timing, foot locking and unlocking states, swing percentages, and smooth cycle transitions. Designed predictive foot placement with arc-based lift motion and precise interpolation to create natural stepping. Added adaptive locomotion features such as stride scaling, dynamic speed control, and advanced foot tracing for uneven terrain, along with subtle secondary body motions to improve realism and reduce mechanical movement.
        <br><br>
        The system delivers a flexible and realistic procedural locomotion setup that adapts stride, speed, and foot placement to movement and terrain. Predictive landing, smooth interpolation, and advanced tracing ensure natural multi-legged motion, while subtle body adjustments enhance realism—all significantly reducing the need for manual animation.
